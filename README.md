# Description
In this project I took on the role of an Information Security Analyst for American International Group, Inc. - AIG.  During the simulation our team received an alert from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), about an emerging vulnerability regarding the open source logging software Apache Log4j.

In response to this alert, my job was to research the vulnerability by analyzing the company's infrastructure list, and drafting an email advisery to the affected teams.  In addition to informing the affected teams, the email was to include a remediation program and assurances to prevent exploitations. 

Research which teams and infrastructures may have been affected by the vulnerability
